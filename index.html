I designed the front, back, and spine, as well as developed the inside pages of the book. For the front cover, I went with a simplisytic design of different birds footprints in the snow. Taking this approach allows for more focus to be placed on the title, as well as to create a sleek design that targets a variety of readers across demographics. The main design on the front cover works its way to the back cover for a seamless design. I chose to put the title in the center of the front cover in big bold type to make it more accessible for a variety of readers abilities, considering possible vision disabilities related with the target population adults 30+60')">

          <img src="images/Magazine.png" alt="Image 2" class="image" onclick="openPopup('This is an editorial collage I designed for my Digital Illustration Class during my third year at Niagara College. The collage is based on an article from the New York Times discussing the NFL and their current concussion protocol. I started with putting the NFL commissioner as the focus of the design, followed by a small percentage of the players that got concussed in the 2022 season hidden within the commissioners jacket. I put tears on the main face to demonstrate emotion, emphasizing the backlash and negative views the NFL has been recieving based on their insufficient concussion protocols. As well, this was further demonstrated by placing a ripped-up title from the article over the commissioners mouth. In the background, I have Twitter comments from players in the NFL with complaints about the league which further shows the need for changes in protocol related to concussions and concussion awareness.')">

When designing the logo, the main aspect that they wanted their hockey jersey to represent was their firefighting uniforms, with the firehouse crest. This crest is represented by a firefighter holding an axe, but instead we altered the crest to examplify the hockey team, where he is holding a hockey stick. We maintained the overall appeal of the crest by ensuring all other aspects were the same to promote authenticity and representation of the fire department. This logo was then placed on the jersey to provide them with a real-life example of how the product would turn out.')">

I designed his face, adding his neck using a drip effect to give the feeling of liquid in his neck. As well, the 999 tattoo represents Juice WRLD’s beliefs in that whatever ill, bad situation, or struggle you are going through, you are always able to turning it into something positive and to ultimately push yourself forward. I included his name at the top of the illustration coming from his mouth like smoke, and finished off the design by placing a halo around Juice WRLD’s head to represent his untimely death.')">

This illustration is supposed to connect to our personal interests while also including a hidden image of a face to represent ourselves. As you can see in the photo, I made three mountains with snow to represent my love for hiking and the winter time. As a child I would often go on winter vacations with my family which still continue to have an impact on my life today. I also included two trees up front to showcase my love for nature. If you look up at the top of the illustration, you can see stars and the moon, I included this simple design to represent my love for the sky at night and its beauty. Finally, I gave the illustration a grain texture to give off the feeling of a cold snowy gust, which further examplifies my love for winter, and nature itself.')">

Everything done in my designs is up to code for Canada Post standards. I chose to make the main focus of my card and stamps around the Canadian white trillium flower, which is the official flower of Ontario. The trillium flower you see is hand-drawn and coloured with pencil crayons and outlined with a sharpy to provide more character and personability for the design. I decided to go with a simple background with varying hues of greens to give a feeling of layered and slit movement. The green also helps to symbolize life and renewal to acompany the growth that is represented through the flower. I chose to use Helvetica for the type as it allows for easy acceible reading across demographics. As well, this type works well in its symplicity with my overall naturalistic design, finishing with a clean and simple design.')">
